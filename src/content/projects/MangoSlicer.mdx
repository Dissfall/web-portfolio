## Project Overview

A native 3D printing slicer for Apple platforms (macOS, iOS, iPadOS, visionOS). Built with Swift and SwiftUI, it brings the slicing workflow to mobile devices, eliminating the need to switch to a desktop for preparing print files. Features include multi-object support, layer visualization, and G-code generation, with plans for advanced capabilities like non-planar slicing.
